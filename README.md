# Procedural Terrain Mesh Generation

### A Unity-Based Procedural Cube Maze Game with Time-Based Challenge

## Overview

**CubeMaze** is a Unity-based cube maze adventure game featuring **procedurally generated terrain using GenP**, offering a unique terrain on every run. The game is designed as a **time-based challenge**, where players must complete the maze within a fixed time limit, enabling competitive play and score-based comparison with others.

This project was developed during **December 2024 – January 2025** as a winter project offered by the **Game Development Club, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur**.
